TODO

- implement brain/NN


DNA Notes

- make the agent
	- goal is to eat and reproduce, for now by itself
	- costructor takes DNA in, whichs contains every info to make it
		- field_view FW
		- max_energy ME
		- speed (1/) SP
		- layers LL
		- neurons NN
		- learning speed (1/) LS 

	- stats are:
		- current energy (same as life for now?); 0 energy dies; full energy it reproduces;
			- every move consumes energy
			- every foods gains energy
		- ticks to next move
